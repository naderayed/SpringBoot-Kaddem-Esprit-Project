This Repo contains an academic project that I have collaborated on with such good classmates and developers.
I was working on authentication and authorization as well as the Equipe section. The rest of the project is credited to:

As I mentioned, I was working on authentication and authorization. For both tasks, I used Spring Security with JWT, with additional configuration to handle CORS errors when consuming APIs. Otherwise, I used Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and other technologies to create CRUD and advanced functionalities
